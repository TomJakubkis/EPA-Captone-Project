# Capstone Project Checklist

The Capstone Project [checklist](./checklist.md) is designed to be your companion throughout your project journey. Rather than viewing it as a simple list of tasks to complete, think of it as your project roadmap that will guide you through both the software development lifecycle and the academic requirements of your project.

## Getting Started

Before diving into your project, take time to familiarise yourself with the entire checklist. Store it somewhere easily accessible&mdash;perhaps in your project documentation folder or your preferred digital note-taking system. While the checklist provides suggested timeframes, you should adapt these to suit your specific project's complexity and your work schedule. Feel free to add your own project-specific items beneath the main points provided.

## Understanding the Project Phases

### Initial Project Setup

The first four weeks are crucial for laying strong foundations. Begin by exploring project ideas that will showcase your software engineering capabilities. Your chosen project should address a genuine business need whilst offering sufficient technical complexity to demonstrate your skills. Complete your ethics and approval forms promptly to avoid any delays in starting your development work.

### Requirements and Planning

During weeks five through eight, focus on thoroughly documenting your software requirements. This documentation will form a significant part of your final report, so be meticulous. Consider setting up a project management system to track your progress. Whether you choose Trello, Jira, or another tool, ensure you're documenting not just what you're doing, but why you're making specific choices. These justifications will prove invaluable during your EPA.

### Design Phase

The design phase spans weeks nine through twelve. Create your design artefacts early, as they'll form crucial evidence of your systematic approach to software development. Keep iterations of your designs to demonstrate your thought process and development journey. Regular consultation with your supervisor and stakeholders during this phase will help ensure you're on the right track before moving into implementation.

### Implementation

The implementation phase occupies weeks thirteen through eighteen. Before writing any code, ensure your development environment is properly configured. Maintain a detailed developer log documenting challenges encountered and solutions implemented. Your commit messages should tell the story of your development process&mdash;make them meaningful and descriptive.

### Testing

Weeks nineteen and twenty focus on testing. Create your test plan before beginning the testing process, and document everything&mdash;including failed tests, as these often provide valuable insights for your report. Your testing should be comprehensive, covering unit tests, integration tests, and user acceptance testing as appropriate.

## Writing Your Report

The report-writing process should begin from day one of your project. Keep a daily log of technical decisions, challenges faced, and solutions implemented. This contemporaneous record will prove invaluable when you begin assembling your final report. The checklist provides a clear structure for your report&mdash;use this to organise your documentation as you go along.

When writing your report, ensure you're regularly cross-referencing your work against the Software Engineer Knowledge and Skills requirements. Your technical explanations should be clear and well-structured, supported by relevant code snippets and diagrams where appropriate.

## Preparing for Your EPA

Start preparing for your End Point Assessment well before the actual date. Your presentation should demonstrate not just what you built, but why you made specific technical choices and how your project showcases your software engineering capabilities. Practice explaining technical concepts clearly, as you'll need to demonstrate both technical proficiency and communication skills.

## Working with Your Supervisor

Regular meetings with your supervisor are essential. Use the checklist during these meetings to track your progress and identify areas where you need guidance. Document the feedback you receive and update your project plan accordingly. Don't hesitate to ask for clarification or support when needed.

## Time Management

Effective time management is crucial for project success. Set your personal deadlines earlier than the final deadlines to give yourself buffer time for unexpected challenges. Remember that technical development is just one aspect of your project&mdash;you'll need to allocate sufficient time for documentation, report writing, and EPA preparation.

## Quality Assurance

Use the checklist as a quality control tool throughout your project. Regularly review your completed work against the requirements, ensuring you're collecting evidence of your development process as you go along. Your technical documentation should be comprehensive and clear, suitable for both technical and non-technical readers.

## Handling Challenges

When you encounter challenges&mdash;and you will&mdash;don't hesitate to seek support. Your project supervisoris available to help. Regular review of your progress against the checklist will help you identify potential issues early, allowing you to address them before they become significant problems.

## Conclusion

Your Capstone Project is an opportunity to demonstrate not just your technical skills, but your ability to manage a complex software development project from conception to delivery. The checklist is designed to support your success&mdash;use it actively, adapt it to your needs, and let it guide you through your journey. Stay organised, maintain clear documentation, and keep sight of both the technical and academic requirements of your project.

By following this structured approach and making full use of the checklist, you'll be well-positioned to deliver a successful Capstone Project that demonstrates your capabilities as a software engineer.
